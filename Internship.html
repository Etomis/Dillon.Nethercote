      <h3>Work Integrated Learning Reflection</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="welcome">
      <div class="balls"><div class="ball"></div></div>
      <p class="InternIntro">
        In the final year of my degree, I took place in the Work Integrated
        Learning industry placement project organised by Griffith University.
        The WIL industry placement in conducted each trimester as an opportunity
        for students to take place in an industry level placement under
        professional supervision with the expectations that students will take
        place in a substantial amount of work that develops the student's
        knowledge expected in a professional environment. This is a reflection
        on my experiences during the placement, not only including the new
        skills, knowledge and understanding of the formal workplace I
        discovered, but also many of the preconceptions I had prior to
        completing the WIL placement, that were challenged throughout. <br />
        <br />
        During the first few weeks I spent at the placement I was exposed to an
        entire ecosystem of technology and software I was unfamiliar with. To be
        frank, this both appeared to be quite intimidating yet very exciting.
        Due to my unique circumstances, I was in the office four days a week
        compared to most students two days, therefore I used the extra time I
        was given to really focus on understanding how the different system
        interacted with each other. It was so much information to consume that
        our team has its own Wikipedia within the ATO's Microsoft Office
        SharePoint. Moreover, the work that I would be interacting with for the
        latter part of the placement and afterwards was through a virtual
        machine that used its own unique set of software and tools that I would
        have to learn. Despite the initial intimidation that I felt, I can
        honestly say that so far, I have enjoyed my time during the placement as
        it has given me the opportunity to work in an industry I enjoy while
        also giving me the freedom to learn and explore. <br />
        <br />
        A major preconception that I had and struggled throughout the placement
        to fully comprehend was the idea that even industry professionals don't
        know all the answers. I cannot legitimately explain why I expected this
        to be the case however shortly after beginning the placement I started
        to question the other employees on how and why systems used within the
        placement functioned. Most of the time they were able to provide an
        answer, yet a few times the questions I had could not be answered when
        first asked. This initially did shock me; however, I slowly began to
        understand that my co-workers used these questions as both moments of
        reflection, and excuses to further develop their own knowledge. This
        thirst for continual improvement that my co-workers displayed helped in
        breaking down the preconception I had which in turn I believe helped me
        view my co-workers as people I could share these experiences with.
        <br />
        <br />
        Another preconception I had was towards the level that industry
        standards were followed and adhered to. While I personally believe that
        my placement coordinated and functioned at a reasonably high level,
        there were still moments throughout the placement, during tasks where I
        had thought to myself, that surely, an organisation as large as the one
        I had placed with, one on a government level would function entirely off
        the industry standards. I wouldn't call the practices I observed ad-hoc,
        however they functioned outside my previous understanding and in most
        cases were uniquely situated to provide efficiency in greater quantities
        that standard procedures most likely would have achieved. <br />
        <br />
        I would argue that these preconceptions I had towards the IT industry
        were shattered by my experiences during the placement. However, I refuse
        to think of these as negative realisations, but proof that a workplace
        can still provide value even if the means aren’t necessarily standard or
        conventional. With these newfound realisations I believe I will be able
        to practise mindfulness in my future experiences, I plan to be more
        understanding of others, knowing that while I shouldn’t expect them to
        know everything, I can still value new knowledge they are able to teach
        me. I also plan to show a greater willingness to accept the processes
        employed across the organisation as ones I can trust, but also
        understand the merit that there is most likely a valuable reason these
        processes are in place. <br />
        <br />
        Upon reflection, I believe that the skills I have learnt and the
        preconceptions I have shattered have helped in preparing me for the
        transition from university to a graduate role. I was lucky enough to
        secure a one-year contract with the Australian Taxation Office, and I
        plan to use what I have learnt so far as a starting point in my career.
        I can only hope that I continue to learn and change in ways that make me
        a better, more valuable person.

        <h3>Technical and Transferable Skills</h3>
      </div>
      <img class="testleft" src="Images/1.png" alt="" />

      <p class="MiddlePara">
        Throughout the time I spent working for the Australian Taxation Office
        during the WIL placement I was able to develop many different technical
        and transferrable skills, some of these I had prior experience in and
        yet many others I have learnt throughout the time I spent during the
        placement, from my manager, my co-workers, and even myself by means of
        reflection. <br />
        <br />
        A technical skill which I have further developed through the placement
        is the programming language SQL. For context, I spent almost a year in
        my degree studying SQL, I surprised myself with how much I enjoyed
        studying a back-end language and by the end of the year I could
        confidently say that I had a strong grasp on the language and knew a
        decent amount of it. However, that was in 2020, and with no reason to
        continue practising the language in my personal life I eventually forgot
        a majority of what made up SQL. In my defence I knew what I had
        forgotten was surface level knowledge, and that if at any time I were to
        practise I believe would quickly remember. However, this did not stop me
        from feeling overwhelmed and unaccomplished when it came time to use
        those skills throughout the placement. Compared to my colleagues, I was
        a child, their experience and knowledge far outweighed mine even at the
        peak of my learning and during the first few weeks I had doubts that I
        was not good enough to participate in the placement. These doubts,
        however, gave room to action. I decided that I would not let myself be
        consumed by the fear of inadequacy. I realised that I was surrounded by
        people that were the perfect teachers, from basic SQL down to the unique
        environments I would be using it for, my colleagues provided not only
        support, but a great platform for learning, that would also increase my
        knowledge of the work environment. Therefore, by accepting this
        placement opportunity I was able to learn, and further develop my
        knowledge of SQL, while also growing a greater bond with those I worked
        with. <br />
        <br />
        A transferrable skill which I value as both a very important discipline
        and a great sign of respect within the workforce is time management. I
        believe that understanding one's own time management is not only a skill
        that benefits the individual but one that is greatly valued in a
        professional environment. For context, on Friday the 22nd of April our
        team was notified of an issue with the live production environment that
        had enabled users to commit fraud. Given the severity of the situation
        our team was placed under immense pressure to develop a fix for the
        issue in a timely manner, that in any other circumstances would have
        taken a month to develop and finalise. However, in utilising good time
        management, amongst other skills, our team was able to develop a fix
        within the week, accounting for a public holiday too. I believe this
        feat was only achievable due to the effort our team took in practicing
        good time management techniques, these included daily stand up / end of
        day meetings, constant updates to the schedule and reflection on what
        was achieved throughout the day, and how that reflection was implemented
        into the team's outlook calendar. <br />
        <br />
        Overall, I believe this experience has further developed my
        understanding of what good time management is and how it is implemented.
        I believe time management can be defined as a transferrable skill due to
        all the situations where it is important, be it your work life, your
        university education and even your personal life. I understand more so
        from this experience that continuing to practice good time management
        will help me throughout my career by being able to keep on track with
        what is required of me in a professional environment. I also believe
        both time management and the knowledge of SQL are important skills
        required in the field of Networks and Security due to the fast-paced
        nature of the line of work, whether that be in securing services you
        work with, attempting to retrieve data that has been stolen, trying to
        catch those who have used the technology illegally and protecting
        databases with the appropriate SQL techniques. I believe by
        participating in the WIL placement I have been able to both learn new
        skills while further developing those I already had experience with and
        to me that shows I still have a lot to learn about both the industry and
        my future career goals.
