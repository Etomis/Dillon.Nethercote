        <p class="AboutMeIntro">
          I am an Information Technology student, majoring in Networks and
          Security at Griffith University, currently in my fourth and final
          year. Some of my passions include, web development, software
          engineering, networking, and security. <br />
          <br />
          I am also currently employed by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO)
          as an IT Application Developer. <br />
          <br />
          The purpose for creating this ePortfolio is to correctly market myself
          by showing off the skills I have developed throughout my time at
          university and work to both potential employers and customers. This
          website includes a showcase of my very best work to date, with the
          intent to impress those interested in my skills professionally.
          <br />
          <br />
          My career goals are very broad as I have many interests within the
          scope of Information Technology, and I personally believe that I would
          be happy with any opportunity if I were placed in an environment where
          I could learn and one that encouraged my interests. However, more than
          other topics, I am interested in a long-term career with Networking
          and Security. My goals would be to acquire a security analyst position
          and follow that career path until I found myself in a position where I
          could mentor future generations. <br />
          <br />

          portfolio examples <a href="Portfolio.html">here</a> for a better
          insight into who I am as a digitally motivated content creator.
